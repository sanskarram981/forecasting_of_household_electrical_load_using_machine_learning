# Forecasting of Household Electrical Load using Machine Learning Algorithm 
<body>
<pre>The aim of the proposed work is to identify & predict the future large-scale electrical energy consumption to
     reduce energy costs with minimum load on the grid. Machine learning methods recently contributed very well in 
     the advancement of the prediction models used for energy consumption. Such models highly improve the accuracy,
     robustness, precision and the generalization ability of the conventional time series forecasting tools.This work 
     reviews the state of the art of ML models used in the general application of energy consumption.This proposed
     work makes a conclusion on the trend and the effectiveness of the ML models. As the result, this work reports
     a satisfactory rise in the accuracy and an ever-increasing performance of the prediction technologies using 
     the novel hybrid and ensemble prediction models. </pre>
